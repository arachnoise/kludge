This is the kludge machine, a simple machine that executes a limited instruction set. It's based on a machine with the same name used for my computer science classes.

 The original was designed as an educational tool used in my computer science classes when I was in college. It was a way to show students how different programming paradigms allowed lesser or greater power over creating abstractions. Specifically, it was a lesson in the pain of machine language programming.

Installation: Extract to your home directory and run make. It's as simple as that.

It's currently set up for a windows gcc-based build environment and compilation has been tested for mingw 4.x with no problems.

See www.mingw.org for help setting up mingw for windows.
